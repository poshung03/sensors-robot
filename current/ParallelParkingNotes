Just consider front car when doing the parking maneuver itself (probably works)
1. Pull up even to front obstacle 
detect obstacle, horizontal distance and alignment
2. Move directly back
3. Turn left throttle 45 degrees (move it down on controller) 
    -- Autonomously, all 3 left motors roll back while right motors do nothing
4. Move directly back*** very softly depending on space available but enough not to hit front obstacle; trial and error including distance from obstacle
5. Turn right throttle 45 degrees (move it down on controller); so that turn right is same amount as turn left so its straight at the end
     - All 3 right motors roll backwards while left motors do nothing
6. Pull up forward (also trial and error)
