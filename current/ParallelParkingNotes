Just consider front car when doing the parking maneuver itself (probably works)
1. Pull up even to front obstacle 
2. Move directly back
3. Turn left throttle 45 degrees (move it down on controller)
4. Move directly back*** very softly depending on space available but enough not to hit front obstacle; trial and error
5. Turn right throttle 45 degrees (move it down on controller); so that turn right is same amount as turn left so its straight at the end
6. Pull up forward (also trial and error)
